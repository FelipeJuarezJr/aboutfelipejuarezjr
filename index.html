<h1>About Felipe Juarez Jr</h1>

<p>Felipe was born in Los Angeles, California.
  At an early age he was interested in electronics because his mother worked in a factory soldering electronics
  and he would visit her there on the weekends.</p>
<p>Felipe is super smart and speaks multiple languages.</p>
<p>In third grade Felipe was introduced to an IBM that used 5.25 disk to run programs and found a passion for
  computers.</p>
<p>Here he is today at his desk, looking like a professional computer whiz. He is going to learn a lot during this bootcamp, and land a super great job after.</p>
<p>A review from a fellow Cohort-41 member: "He seems like one cool cat, and I look forward to working with him! 5 stars!" -Elise</p>
